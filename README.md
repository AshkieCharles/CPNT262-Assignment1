- The reason why are all the images are named from 1-9 is because it makes it easier for my to create a for loop with only the inter going up rather than a random list of names. Because if it was names I would have to create a list and create a loop within a loop to prevent the same name from appearing twice which I think is too hard for now but I do have an idea on how you would do it.
- So I didn't read the rubric that closely and failed to see that I needed an array of objects for the loop! So I asked for some assistance from Edward on how he did his.
